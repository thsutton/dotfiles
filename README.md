Dotfiles
========

This repository contains the dotfiles I carry around with me from system to
system. There's nothing terribly interesting in here.

If you do want to use them, try something like this:

````
git clone https://github.com/thsutton/dotfiles $HOME/.dotfiles
cd $HOME/.dotfiles
git submodule init
git submodule update
````

Then symlink the all the files into place.
