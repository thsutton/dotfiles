1 Introduction
**************

PHP mode is a major mode for editing PHP source code in Emacs.  As an
extension of Emacs's C mode, it inherits all C mode's navigation and
editing functionality.  Syntax elements of PHP source code is colored
according to the grammar of PHP versions 3, 4 and 5.  By default, the
indent rules follow the PHP PEAR coding guidelines.  Additional aids
for developing in PHP include documentation search of the PHP manual,
code completion and a class browser.

   To find out what version of PHP mode you have installed run `M-x
php-mode-version'.

   PHP mode was first released in 1999 and was written by Turadg
Aleahmad.  At the time of PHP mode's initial release, version 2 of PHP
(PHP/FI) was only 2 years old and the release of PHP 3 had happened the
year before.  In May of 2000, PHP 4 was released.  Subsequent versions
of PHP mode scurried to support the quickly evolving syntax of this
emerging programming language.

   In 2001, PHP mode became a SourceForge project and version 1.0 was
released later that year.  Further refinements of the Emacs library
included improvements to the syntax coloring rules, portability between
XEmacs and GNU Emacs, integration of various development tools
available in various Emacsen.

   PHP mode's support for PHP 5 first appeared in 2004, the same year
PHP 5 was released.  2004 was the last year Aleahmad made a release.
In 2005, Lennart Borgman combined a forked version of PHP mode with his
"new XML mode for Emacs" (nXhtml).  The stalled development of PHP
resulted in people sharing various patches and improvements to PHP mode
over the Internet.

   The 1.4 release in 2008 represented a renewed commitment to the
Emacs Lisp library with the addition of considerable updates and
improvements - the first in over 2 years.

   This manual describes PHP mode for practiced Emacs users especially
those who have read or can refer to the Emacs manual.  The reader
should already know how to program in PHP, although one could easily
learn how to program PHP using PHP mode and Emacs.  There are no
explanations of PHP programming in this manual.

2 Installation
**************

PHP mode can be installed like any Emacs Lisp library.

   Download a source archive of the file.  It is available from PHP
mode's Web site.

   `http://php-mode.sourceforge.net/'

   Download either the file `php-mode-1.5.0.tar.gz' or
`php-mode-1.5.0.zip'.  Both source files have a respective GnuPG(1)
signature file with a .SIG file name extension.

   To verify the source archive you need the key of the maintainer.
The public key can be downloaded from the Web site and imported, or
imported from a key server.

     $ gpg --recv-keys 8E372922
     gpg: requesting key 8E372922 from hkp server keys.gnupg.net
     gpg: key 8E372922: public key
     "Aaron S. Hawley (SourceForge) <ashawley@users.sourceforge.net>"
     imported

   The public key can also be imported from a file.

     $ gpg --import ashawley-sf-pubkey.asc
     gpg: key 8E372922: public key

   Verify a source package by using the GPG verify command on the
signature file with the source file located in the same directory.

     $ gpg --verify php-mode-1.4.0.tar.gz.sig
     gpg: Signature made Fri 25 Jan 2008 01:30:24 PM EST

                              D07D 7087 6760 8E37 2922

   After the source package is verified, unpack the source archive.

     $ tar zxf php php-mode-1.5.0.tar.gz

   The files are extracted to the directory `php-mode-1.5.0'.  Run
`make' in the directory to build all the formats of the documentation -
Info, HTML, PostScript and PDF.  Read the notes in the `Makefile' to
learn how to run `make' to compile the manual into a single particular
format.

   If you have a local directory where Emacs Lisp libraries are stored,
for example `~/elisp', then put the following in your `.emacs' file if
you haven't already

     (add-to-list 'load-path "~/elisp")

   Then, put the file `php-model.el' into your Emacs `load-path',
`~/elisp', and add `php-mode' to your `.emacs' file.

     (load "php-mode")

   From inside Emacs, run `M-x customize-variable RET php-file-patterns
RET'.  This variable instructs Emacs what file names should be opened
in PHP mode.  If the defaults are fine, then click or hit `RET' on
`Save for Future Sessions'.

   Alternatively, put these lines in your `.emacs' file.

     (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist
     	     '("\\.php[34]?\\'\\|\\.phtml\\'" . php-mode))

   If you work on projects, like Drupal, that use other extension for
PHP source file, you may need to add this to your `.emacs'.

     (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.module\\'" . php-mode))
     (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.inc\\'" . php-mode))

3 Electricity
*************

Certain characters when inserted in Emacs have "electricity".  Emacs
recognizes them as "electric" and automatically reacts in some way to
their insertion.  This is unlike the `self-insert-command' - the
conventional manner Emacs inserts most characters into the buffer and
without side-effect.

   For example, the indent commands for programming language modes -
including PHP mode - are electric.  Hitting `TAB' (or `C-i') typically
indents the line to the correct column based on the nested declaration
blocks or conditional (control) syntax statements.  Other examples of
electric characters include braces ({ and }), characters related to
comments (#, / and *), and semicolons.  Inserting "electric" characters
causes the line to be automatically be indented appropriately by PHP
mode.

   Should PHP mode ever do something you wish it didn't, like indenting
incorrectly after inserting a character when you wish it didn't, then
you've been "electrocuted".  To avoid this, use `quoted-insert' by
prefixing the character with `C-q'.  For example, `C-q TAB' for a tab.
Alternatively, disable the electric effect of PHP mode with `C-c C-l'.
Issue `C-c C-l' again to activate the electric effect again.

4 Motion
********

The traditional point movement commands for Emacs(1) and Emacs's C
mode(2) are supported in PHP mode.  The following are noteworthy
commands for working on PHP code or are extensions expressly provided
by PHP mode.

`C-M-f'
     Move forward past the current syntax (`forward-sexp').  If point
     is in a string literal, move to the end of the string.  If point
     is at the beginning of a parenthetical expression, move to the end
     of it.  If at the beginning of statement block that is surrounded
     by braces, move to the end of the block.  If point is at an
     identifier, skip to the end of it.  

`C-M-b'
     Same as `C-M-f', except a syntactic element move to its beginning
     (`backward-sexp').  

`C-M-a'
     Move point to the beginning of the top-level function definition
     (`c-beginning-of-defun').  

`C-M-e'
     Move point to the end of the top-level function definition
     (`c-end-of-defun').  

`C-M-<HOME>'
     Move point to the beginning of the current function
     (`beginning-of-defun').  

`C-M-<END>'
     Move point to the end of the current function (`end-of-defun').  

`M-m'
     Move to the indentation at the beginning of the line
     (`back-to-indentation').  

`C-c C-w'
     Enable word motion across mixed case identifiers with
     `forward-word' and `backward-word' commands (`c-subword-mode').
   Most movement commands support prefixing the command with a "numeric
argument" by using Emacs's "universal argument" command.  Type `C-u N',
where N is the number of times to repeat a command.  If no number N is
provided, Emacs will repeat the command 4 times by default.  *Note
Numeric Arguments: (emacs)Arguments.

5 Indentation
*************

PHP mode's indentation settings inherit the defaults set by Emacs C
mode, or the rules customized for C mode.(1)

   PHP mode provides indentation settings that follow the PHP PEAR
"Coding Standards"(2).  It has the consequence in PHP mode of making
the indentation commands use four spaces, and not tabs.  This setting is
turned on whenever the file name associated with a buffer includes the
string "PEAR", case insensitive and the file ends in ".php".

   You can force the use of this setting for all files edited with PHP
mode by setting `php-mode-force-pear' to non-nil.  Configure the
variable with either `M-x customize-variable RET php-mode-force-pear
RET', or by setting its value in your Emacs initialization file
(`~/.emacs').

   PHP does not appropriately indent HTML tags.  *Note Embedded HTML::.

   To customize PHP mode's indentation rules, change the following
variables.

`c-basic-offset'
     This style variable of C mode controls how many columns in the
     level of indentation.  By default this is 4 spaces in PHP mode
     (and in C mode).  

`indent-tabs-mode'
     Variable of Emacs that determines whether indentation commands
     should insert the tab character or insert the equivalent number of
     space characters.  In PHP mode, this is set to to nil by default.  

`tab-width'
     This variable of Emacs determines how "wide" a tab in the buffer
     should be considered.  This is also traditionally described as
     setting the distance between "tab stops".  By default, PHP mode
     does not insert tabs for indentation.

`php-mode-force-pear'
     Use the indentation rules of PHP PEAR for all files opened in PHP
     mode.  See above.


   The usual commands for indenting in Emacs(3) and Emacs's C mode(4):
are supported in PHP mode, following the indentation rules of PHP.

`TAB'
     Properly indent current line, even from the middle of the line
     (`c-indent-command').  

`C-j'
     Insert text after point to a newline, and properly indent the
     newline (`c-indent-command').  

`C-M-\'
     Properly indent each line of region (`indent-region').  

`C-c C-q'
     Properly indent each line of current top-level function or
     top-level class (`c-indent-defun').

6 Editing
*********

`M-q'
     Fill the paragraph to current value of `fill-column'.  The command
     does the right thing for indented code and PHP comments including
     Docblock comments.  

`C-u N C-x f'
     Set the `fill-column' to N when using the `M-q' command
     (`fill-paragraph').  

`C-M-h'
     Mark the current function (`c-mark-function').  Puts the mark at
     the end and of the function and the point at the beginning.
     Useful if you want to kill the region with `C-w' or `M-w', or
     indent the region with `C-M-\' or `C-x TAB' (*Note Indentation::.).  

`M-x mark-defun'
     Like `C-M-h' (`c-mark-function'), except place the mark at the end
     of the function even if it's not at the top-level.  With functions
     that are methods defined in a class, they may be indented and not
     top-level functions, however this command will only mark the
     current function.


   The traditional commands for narrowing to a region in Emacs(1) are
supported in PHP mode.  The following commands are notable to mention
for working with PHP or are extensions expressly provided PHP mode.

`C-x n d'
     Narrow the buffer to the contents of the current function
     (`narrow-to-defun').  This will narrow to the function as
     identified to the current function, even if it is nested in an
     object or another function.  The logic to narrow the function is
     the same as the `beginning-of-defun' and `end-of-defun' commands -
     see *Note Motion::, and the `mark-defun' command - see above.  

`C-x n w'
     Undo any narrowing by widening the buffer again by making the rest
     of the buffer available (`widen').

7 Completion
************

Completing function names, identifiers and PHP keywords is possible in
PHP mode.  In PHP mode, it is possible to complete identifiers defined
by the PHP programming language, and to complete functions defined by
you.

   For PHP mode to know the functions of keywords of PHP, it must have
access to the PHP manual.  Download the HTML archive of the manual made
of separate files for each function.(1) Unpack the files to a
directory, and define the variable `php-manual-path' to the location of
these files.  Configure this setting with either `M-x
customize-variable RET php-manual-path RET', or by setting its value in
your Emacs initialization file (`~/.emacs').

   For functions and classes you define, you'll need to provide them to
Emacs as a "tag file".(2) Creating a tag file (`TAGS') from a PHP
source code file is done by running the `etags' command on the file.(3)
The `etags' command can even generate tag files for providing
completion across multiple files.  For larger projects and PHP coded
libraries, use a system like a Makefile to generate and maintain the
tag tables.

   Run,

     etags FILE

   to create a `TAGS' file for FILE.

   To generate a `TAGS' file for all the PHP files in the current
directory, run

     etags *.php

   To enable a tags file you need to use the following command.

`C-u M-x visit-tags-table'
     Specify the `TAGS' file that PHP mode should use to find
     completion candidates for the current buffer.

`M-x visit-tags-table'
     Specify the `TAGS' file that PHP mode should use to find
     completion candidates for all buffers, and even other modes other
     than PHP mode.


   If you are interested in any one or more of the following consider
using the variable `php-completion-file'.

  1. avoid regenerating the completion table from the PHP manual every
     Emacs session,

  2. generating a completion file from a facility external to Emacs
     tags,

  3. or provide more granular control over the completion rules for
     files;


   Configure this setting with either `M-x customize-variable RET
php-completion-file RET', or by setting its value in your Emacs
initialization file (`~/.emacs').

   To create a file that can be set for `php-completion-file', create
with the following shell commands with the HTML version of the PHP
manual installed at `/usr/share/doc/php-manual/en/html'.

     $ cd /usr/share/doc/php-manual/en/html
     $ ls -1 function*.html \
       | sed -e 's/^function\.\([-a-zA-Z_0-9]*\)\.html/\1/' \
       | tr - _ \
       > ~/.emacs.d/php/php-completion-file

   In larger projects or with other specific needs, conventional
methods of setting these and other variables may be inadequate.  As of
2008, third-party packages do exist for Emacs to configure Emacs
settings on groups of files or for directory trees, including
`dirvars.el'.

`M-TAB'

`ESC TAB'

`C-[ TAB'
     Complete function name at point (`php-complete-function').  

`C-.'
     Show in the minibuffer the argument list for the current function
     at point (`php-show-arglist').  The argument list is generated by
     finding and jumping to the respective function's location
     specified in the tag file (see above).  The argument list is then
     read and printed to the minibuffer.

8 PHP Comments
**************

The usual commands for inserting, managing and editing source code
comments in Emacs(1) and Emacs's C mode(2) are supported in PHP mode.
The following noteworthy commands are useful for working with PHP or are
extensions expressly provided by PHP mode.

`M-;'
     Insert comment at point (`comment-dwim').  If comment already
     exist, indent comment (`comment-indent').  

`M-j'
     Insert a newline in a comment on the next line with the comment
     starting at the same column as the current line
     (`c-indent-new-comment-line').  

`C-x ;'
     Set the current column as the column to start comments from in the
     buffer (`comment-set-column').  This affects the variable
     `comment-column'.  

`C-c C-c'
     Comment out the current region (`comment-region').  If region is
     already commented, the region is uncommented.  

`M-- C-x ;'

`C-u M-;'
     Kill the comment on the current line (`comment-kill' called by
     `comment-set-column' or `comment-dwim').

`C-u N M-;'
     Kill the next N comments (`comment-dwim').  

`M-x comment-box'
     Surround region with comment characters.

9 PHP Documentation
*******************

PHP mode supports the online documentation available from
`http://www.php.net/'.  The `browse-url' system of Emacs supports these
commands.  Run the Emacs command `M-x customize-group RET browse-url
RET' to configure how `browse-url' behaves.  For example, you may want
to change the Web browser Emacs uses for visiting a page of the manual
for PHP.

`C-c C-m'

`C-c RET'
     Browse PHP manual in a Web browser.  

`C-c C-f'
     Search PHP manual using identifier at point.

10 Index Menu
*************

PHP mode provides a menu of the functions and classes defined in the
current buffer.  The menu is pretty simple, but is helpful when
navigating large files.  The contents of the menu also provide a good
overview to the user about the file's contents.

   To enable this menu, run the following command.

`M-x imenu-add-menubar-index'
     Scan the file for functions and class declarations, then add a
     menu item called "Index" to the menu bar.


   In the menu will be any one or more of the following menu items.

`All Functions'
     A sub-menu containing the names of functions defined in the
     current buffer.  Clicking on a function name will visit the
     location of the function's definition.  

`Classes'
     A sub-menu containing the names of classes defined in the current
     buffer.  Clicking on a class name will visit the location of the
     class's definition.

`Public Methods, Private Methods, Protected Methods'
     Each of these three "method" sub-menus list the names of objects
     methods defined as "public", "private" or "protected".  Clicking
     on a method name will visit the location of the function's
     definition.  

`*Rescan*'
     Rescan the contents of the current buffer, and update both the
     indexes the entries in the menu.


   To have Emacs automatically rescan the current buffer, change the
setting for `imenu-auto-rescan' to non-nil with either `M-x
customize-variable RET php-completion-file RET', or by setting its
value in your Emacs initialization file (`~/.emacs').

11 Change Logs
**************

PHP mode can help generate `ChangeLog' files, a widely-adopted format
for documenting the changes made to source code-especially software.
PHP mode and Emacs will determine the current function, file name,
author information and date and use it all to prepare a properly
formatted `ChangeLog' entry in the file.

   The `add-change-log-entry' commands can be run from within a buffer
containing a PHP buffer, or from a buffer in Diff mode with a revision
patch to a PHP source file.  *Note Diff Mode: (emacs)Diff Mode.

`C-x 4 a'
     Add an entry in a `ChangeLog' file opened in another window, or
     add a new line to the already begun entry
     (`add-change-log-entry-other-window').  Provides the file name and
     the respective function name, when applicable, for the current
     point.  The point can be in a PHP source file, or in the hunk of a
     diff file.(1)  This command will also add the current author and

13 Customization
****************

Customization for PHP mode can be done using Emacs's "Customize"
feature(1), or by adding bits of Emacs Lisp to your Emacs initialization
file (`~/.emacs').

`M-x customize-group RET php RET'
     Start a `*Customize*' buffer with the customizable settings for
     PHP mode.

Appendix A Embedded HTML
************************

The PHP programming language is commonly embedded with HTML but also
with other markup formats.  Unfortunately, PHP mode is currently unable
to recognize these other bits and provide commands that behave
appropriately.  Other Emacs modes for properly indenting HTML include
HTML mode, SGML mode and XML mode.

   For example, when editing the HTML sections found in a PHP file,
consider turning on HTML mode with `M-x html-mode'.  Use the the
mode-specific commands for manipulating the HTML.  When finished, turn
back on PHP mode with `M-x php-mode' to return working on the PHP
sections of the file.

   Alternatively, consider using a "multiple major mode" like mumamo,
mmm-mode or multi-mode.  These modes allow a single buffer to appoint
different major modes to respective portions of the buffer.

Appendix C Copying This Manual
******************************

                      Version 1.2, November 2002

     Copyright (C) 2000,2001,2002 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
     can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You
     accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a
     way requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
     Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
     The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document
     does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of
     markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
     modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format is
     not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A
     copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
     human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats include
     PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
     XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
     produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from
     which the general network-using public has access to download
     using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent
     copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed
          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the
          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
          that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
          the Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in
          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,
          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in
          the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in
          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a
          work that was published at least four years before the
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
          it refers to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the
          section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
          titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other
     attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.
